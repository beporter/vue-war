# Coding Challenge Instructions

Implement one round of the card game War using the API found at deckofcardsapi.com. Your game. should work like this:

* [x] User presses a "Start Game" button to start the game
* [ ] Your program requests a new deck of cards from the API (player A)
* [ ] Your program requests a second new deck of cards from the API (player B)
* [ ] Your program draws one card from each deck and displays the cards on screen
* [ ] Whichever player has the higher card gets a point (Aces are high)
* [ ] The point total for each player is displayed
* [ ] User presses a "Draw Cards" button to continue the game
* [ ] Repeat steps 4 through 7 until no cards remain
* [ ] Display which player won

In this simplified version, if there is a tie (both players draw identical cards), neither player gets a point.


## Language and framework

Write your code using PHP, Python, Ruby or JavaScript. (If you want to use another language, ask first.)

You may use a framework or library (Flask, Django, Rails, React, jQuery, etc.) but are not required to do so.


## Time limit

Don't spend more than two hours on this. If you get it done in less time, that's fine, too. If you don't finish in two hours, send what you have.


## Scope

Do not spend time making it fancy (i.e. no animations or special effects).

Do not write any unit, integration, acceptance or other types of tests.


## Submitting your project


* Create a private GitHub repository for your project.
* When you are done, invite GitHub user paulschreiber as a collaborator and send Paul an email.


## Evaluation

In addition to correctness, we want to see

- (a) clean, readable, well-documented code that's idiomatic to your language and
- (b) good commit messages.
